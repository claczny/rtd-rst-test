Welcome to our 8-day EMBO Practical Course on integrating multi-omic data to study mixed microbial communities.
You can find the detailed schedule on the `course website <https://meetings.embo.org/event/20-microbial-communities#Programme>`_.
Here, in the left sidebar, you can find entries that guide you to the respective materials.
These may be links to relevant papers, slides, or instructions on how to run the individual computational parts that we will introduce and explain in this course.


A brief explanation of the main organizational elements on this website:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- A link looks as follows:

    `this is a link which brings you to Google <http://www.google.com/>`_.

- A code block looks like the following:


::

    Code blocks are in typewriter font and detail commands that should be executed
    Some of these commands will run quickly, other will take longer.

and this is how ``inline code`` looks like.

Most of the time, these code blocks are provided to reduce the typing efforts and to reduce typographical errors.
However, please note that in some cases, you might need to replace parts of the code blocks to reflect your situation, e.g., replace a placeholder by your user name.
In other cases, the code blocks are used to highlight programmatic aspects, e.g., as shown for the `project layout`_.
